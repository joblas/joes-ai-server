# Your Private AI Server — Quick Start Guide

**Powered by Joe's Tech Solutions LLC**

## Welcome!

You now have your own private AI chat server. It works just like ChatGPT, but your conversations stay on YOUR server — nothing is sent to OpenAI, Google, or anyone else.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Open Your AI Server

Open your browser and go to your AI server URL (provided by Joe).

### 2. Create Your Account

The first person to sign up becomes the **admin**. Choose a strong password — this is the key to your AI server.

### 3. Download a Model

Before you can chat, you need to download an AI model:

1. Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) in the sidebar
2. Go to **Admin Panel** → **Settings** → **Models**
3. In the "Pull a model" field, type one of these and click the download button:

| Model | Size | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen3:4b` | ~2.6 GB | Rivals 72B quality, great for 8GB machines |
| `qwen3:8b` | ~5.2 GB | Sweet spot performance, 40+ tokens/sec |
| `gemma3:12b` | ~8.1 GB | Google multimodal, strong reasoning |
| `deepseek-r1:8b` | ~4.9 GB | Advanced reasoning and coding |
| `qwen3:32b` | ~20 GB | Near-frontier quality, rivals GPT-4 |

**Recommendation:** Start with `qwen3:4b` — it's fast, fits on most hardware, and rivals much larger models.

### 4. Start Chatting!

Select your downloaded model from the dropdown at the top, then type your question. That's it!

## Tips & Tricks

**Upload Documents:** Click the 📎 icon to upload PDFs, text files, or images. The AI will read and answer questions about them.

**Multiple Conversations:** Use the sidebar to create new chats and keep topics organized.

**Add More Users:** As admin, go to Admin Panel → Users to manage who has access.

**Switch Models:** Different models have different strengths. Try a few to see which you prefer.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is my data private?**
Yes. Everything runs on your server. No data is sent to any third party.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
If running on a local computer — yes, once models are downloaded. On a VPS, you need internet to connect to it.

**Q: How do I update?**
Updates happen automatically every night at 4 AM. You don't need to do anything.

**Q: Something isn't working. Who do I contact?**
Email **joe@joestechsolutions.com** — I'll get back to you within 24 hours.

## Important Security Notes

1. **Change ENABLE_SIGNUP to false** after all your users have created accounts (ask Joe to do this)
2. **Use strong passwords** for all accounts
3. **Don't share your server URL** publicly unless you want strangers signing up
